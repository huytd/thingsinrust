Things in Rust
==============

In this repository, I put my implementations for various things in Rust.

1. What included?
----------------

Here is the list:

  - Binary Tree (binary_tree/binary_tree.rs)
  - ...

2. How to run?
--------------

The codes can be compiled with `rustc`:

  $ rustc <source-file> -o <output>

For example:

  $ rustc binary_tree.rs -o binary_tree

Then you can run the output binary file:

  $ ./binary_tree
